    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a delightful dish combining the unique flavors of Italian Marsala wine with the white meat of the chicken breast. The dish has been sweetened to appeal to a broader range of those who appreciate the fun of cooking with fine wines.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 slice onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
        <li>2 cups Marsala wine</li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon molasses</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon corn syrup</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cold water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded flat</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onion, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir mushrooms, onion, and garlic into the melted butter, increase heat to medium-high, and cook and stir the mixture until the mushrooms are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir Marsala wine, chicken stock, brown sugar, lemon juice, molasses, and corn syrup into the mushroom mixture; bring to a boil and cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid reduces by about half, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk cornstarch into cold water in a small bowl. Stream the cornstarch slurry into the Marsala sauce, stirring continually; cook and stir until the sauce thickens, another 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil with 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook chicken until golden brown until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Arrange each chicken breast into the center of a plate. Drizzle Marsala sauce over each chicken breast; garnish with green onion to serve.</li>
